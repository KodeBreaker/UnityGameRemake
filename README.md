# UnityGameRemake
A 2D endless runner where you play as a little blue knight that runs on platforms, avoids traps and collect coins.
It has a few bugs that needs to be fixed. I will fix these bugs sometime soon but right now im currently busy with assignments.
I used animations for game objects that required them. I used object pooling for the the continious spawning of coins, traps and paltforms. Coins are collected by trigger colliders.
